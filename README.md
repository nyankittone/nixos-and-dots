# NixOS Configuration and extra dotfiles
This repo mainly contains a flake for both a NixOS configuration that I use, and a home-manager
configuration that is called by the NixOS one. It also contains a bunch of dotfiles, both used by
the Nix config, and completely separate from it, managed independently.

TODO: write a more comprehensive README.
