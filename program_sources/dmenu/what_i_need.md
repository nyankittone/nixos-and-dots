# What am I looking for in a menu generator?
* Displaying little menus at the bottom of the screen for the following:
  * Launching applications through their desktop entry file
  * Running arbitrary shell commands
  * Clipboard management
  * Emoji selector
  * Launching virtual machines and emulator games
    * Should I do this in their own separate menus? Or should they be integrated with launching apps?
  * dwm crash recovery menu
  * Selecting memes from my memes folders
  * NetworkManager interface
* All types of menus should be in a different color to differentiate them
